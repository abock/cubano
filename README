Cubano is a new user interface for the Banshee Media Player. It aims to be
very simple and usable on devices with small screens, like netbooks.

It uses Clutter for accelerated video playback and some fancy effects in
the "Now Playing" interface, and leverages Banshee's powerful UI libraries
for media management.

Cubano is "bleeding edge" and requires a very up-to-date dependency stack,
and is being rapidly developed. It is not ready for packaging in distributions
or general use just yet.

  * Mono 2.4
  * Banshee 1.5.0
  * clutter 0.9.3 (git master)
  * clutter-gtk 0.9.1 (git master)
