Cubano is a Moonlight/XAML based client for the Banshee Media Player
http://banshee-project.org/

Cubano currently requires Moonlight from trunk, but works with a stock
Mono 2.0 or newer. Lots of changes are happening against Moonlight to 
make it a first class citizen for developing desktop applications,
and Cubano aims to be the first major Linux Desktop application developed
with Silverlight technology.

Building Moonlight from trunk to work as a desktop platform is actually
very easy.

In the directory above your cubano checkout:

  svn co http://anonsvn.mono-project.com/source/trunk/moon
  cd moon

  ./autogen.sh --disable-browser-support
  make

You do not need to specifiy a prefix, as you do not need to 'make install'.
Installing Moonlight from trunk into your system is not recommended.

Once you have built Moonlight, go back into the top of your cubano directory.

  ./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr
  make
  make run

If configure complains that it cannot find Moonlight, you must specify
the full path to your Moonlight checkout above like this:

  ./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr --with-moonlight-source=/home/me/svn/moon

By default, cubano's configure tries to find your Moonlight checkout at
../moon, so if you have checked both Moonlight and Cubano out into the same
directory, you should not need to specify the path to Moonlight.
